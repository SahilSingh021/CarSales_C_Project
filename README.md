# CarSales_C_Project

This project marked the beginning of my university experience in Semester 1, known as 'Introduction to Programming.' A key requirement was to submit the code in a single .txt file, resulting in the inclusion of all project code within the main.c file.

I've included all the university-mandated requirements in the attached 'Project-Requirements.txt' file.
